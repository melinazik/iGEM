								things about Osteoarthritis in pathophysiological and molecular level so that we had a
								clearer idea on what is happening in a joint when a patient suffers from Osteoarthritis.
								We tried to answer the following questions: How it begins? What causes it? Which
								molecules and cell types play an important role in an Osteoarthritic joint? Which are
								the existing therapies for this disease? What should happen in order to stop the
								progression of the disease.

								<br><br>

								Trying to answer these questions we had the need as a team to have a meeting with
								someone who has experience with this disease and is a professional Orthopaedic Surgeon.
								For that purpose, we prepared a presentation about our team, the competition and our
								idea as it was in the beginning and contacted Dr. Georgios I. Drosos (Orthopaedic
								Surgeon and a Chairman at the University Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and a
								Professor of Orthopaedics in the School of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace).
								Thankfully Dr. Drosos was very interested in our project which led to his recruitment in
								our team on 10/12 as a PI to help us throughout the duration of the competition.

								Our Wet Lab team had done a lot of research. We were at a very good level of knowledge

								if we concluded in any of them. Therefore, we needed the opinion of an experienced one,

								For that purpose, we worked in this week to prepare a document which meticulously

								focused more on collecting the necessary amount of money for our registration to the

								<br><br>

								During that period our Wet Lab, while facing some difficulties with the genetic circuit,
								decided to consider other possibilities. We examined the use of an RNA circuit instead
								of the DNA genetic circuit. We studied about RNA circuits in general and we tried to
								design an RNA circuit suitable for our approach.

								<br><br>

								Another aspect that we had to consider and conclude, was which factors would be
								expressed by our Circuit. So, we expanded our range of factors to small interfering and
								micro RNA molecules as well, as they seemed to have many potential as therapeutic
								molecules.

								Based on our research, an idea came up to surface. We thought of using exosomes as a

								studied about the use of exosomes as a therapeutic and learned about the fundamental
								mechanisms on how exosomes are being produced and how they can be modified. We found out
								that various Guiding tags could be fused to the membranes of exosomes so that they could
								specifically target certain cell types.

								After our preparation for the meeting, we had a call with Mr. Skretas on 11/05. He
								helped us understand that the use of RNA circuits was a little difficult, mainly because
								of the short life of RNA molecules. Therefore, our initial DNA circuit was still a part
								of our approach. After the discussion about the exosomes, we concluded that this was
								indeed a viable approach and we had high hopes of sticking to this idea, while he also
								encouraged us to work with miRNAs as well.
								<br><br>


								Mr. Skretas also suggested contacting a fellow scientist Mr.Garinis, who was running a
								project at that time using exosomes to get some more feedback on the use of exosomes.

								He later helped us to contact the designers of the genetic circuit that we were

								On 13/05 we finally reached Mrs. Maria Margy Koffa and held our meeting. We presented to

								discussed about her recruitment as a Principal Investigator and the possibility of
